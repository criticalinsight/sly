# Sly 🦀

> **Maximum Intelligence, Minimum RAM. Persistent Autonomy.**

Sly is a high-performance, single-binary autonomous coding agent written in **Rust**. It is designed specifically for **Apple Silicon** to provide a lightning-fast, native AI pair programmer experience without the bloat of Python, Node.js, or Docker.

## 🚀 Key Features (v0.2.4)

*   **Multi-Agent Swarm**: Spawn parallel "Worker Nanos" to handle independent subsystems concurrently.
*   **Self-Evolution**: Dynamic tool generation via compiled `.wasm` plugins for specialized tasks.
*   **Multimodal Vision**: Screenshot capture passed to LLM for visual UI verification.
*   **Debate Loops**: Multi-persona LLM sessions to audit complex logic changes.
*   **Rollback Snapshots**: Zero-cost restoration of workspace state via `.sly/snapshots`.
*   **Semantic Linting**: LLM-guided linting for catching logical API misuse.
*   **Auto-Didact Engine**: Automatically learns your tech stack by scanning manifests and scraping official documentation.
*   **Memory**: Active RAG via **CozoDB** and Metal-accelerated embeddings (**BGE**).
*   **Cortex**: Powered by **Gemini 3.0** with **Thinking Levels** (`High` / `Low`).
*   **Godmode**: Event-driven QoS + `OverlayFS` safety shield for transactional edits.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/criticalinsight/sly.git
cd sly
cargo install --path .
```
> [!TIP]
> Ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your `$PATH`. You can then run the agent simply by typing `sly`.

### 2. Initialize a Workspace
Go to your project directory and run:
```bash
sly init
```
This creates the isolated `.sly` directory and a default `config.toml`.

### 3. Setup Environment
Ensure your `.env` file in the project directory has your API key:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 4. Ignite the Brain
```bash
sly
```

## 🎮 Usage

Once running, you maintain a conversation with Sly or add tasks to `TASKS.md`.

### Configuration (`.sly/config.toml`)
```toml
project_name = "my-awesome-app"
autonomous_mode = true          # Set to true for headless operation
max_autonomous_loops = 50       # Circuit breaker for API spend
primary_model = "gemini-3-flash-preview"
```

### Slash Commands
- `/path <path>`: Change the target codebase directory.
- `/status`: Show memory usage, session turns, and token counts.
- `/clear`: Wipe the current session history (RAM only).
- `/exit`: Quit the agent.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for current goals.

## ⚠️ Safety Notice

Sly can execute shell commands and modify files.
- The **OverlayFS Safety Shield** ensures all edits are transactional and specualtive.
- **The Crucible** build-gate prevents corrupted commits in Rust projects.
- **The Governor** prevents dangerous autonomous actions like `git push --force`.
- **Always** commit your work before letting an agent modify your codebase.
